Spectrum Sprint is a simple arcade-style game in which the player must collect colorful boxes while avoiding obstacles. The game features randomly generated levels and increasing difficulty as the player progresses through the levels.

<b>How to Play</b>

The goal of the game is to collect as many boxes as possible while avoiding obstacles. The player can move the white ball using the arrow keys. Each box the player collects adds one point to their score. If the white ball touches an obstacle, the game is over.

Press the space bar to activate a bomb that destroys all the boxes within a certain radius.
